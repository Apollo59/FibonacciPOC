# FibonacciPOC

This is a proof of concept I made for Fibonacci's sequence which the first number and the second number are add together starting at 0 and 1 
so
0 + 1 = 1 
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
and so forth
just run main.py and it will ask you how many times you would like Fibonacci to run

Sorry for spagehtti code. I think it was 11pm when I made this.
